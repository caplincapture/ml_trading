###Lesson summary 
To read multiple stocks into a single dataframe, you need to: 
Specify a set of dates using pandas.date_range 
Create an empty dataframe with dates as index 
    This helps align stock data and orders it by trading date 
Read in a reference stock (here SPY) and drop non-trading days using pandas.DataFrame.dropna 
Incrementally join dataframes using pandas.DataFrame.join 
Once you have multiple stocks, you can: Select a subset of stocks by ticker symbols Slice by row (dates) and column (symbols) 
Plot multiple stocks at once (still using pandas.DataFrame.plot) 
Carry out arithmetic operations across stocks, e.g. normalize by the first day's price Hit Next to continue.
